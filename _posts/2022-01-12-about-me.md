# All About Me!
Hi everyone! My name is Kaylin Dinsmore (she/her) and I am a junior from Virginia Beach, VA! I am an English (Writing) major with minors in Communication Studies and Childhood Studies. I took this course as an elective for my English major and I thought it looked like an interesting topic! I don't consider myself _super_ technologically savvy so I thought this course would be a great way for me to expand both my digital and writing skills to help me in my future endeavors!

At home, I live with my mom, dad, and little sister, who is 17 and a junior in high school. We have 4 cats who are all boys named Lucky, Jimmy, Snap, and Benny. Lucky is our oldest, being 8 years old, followed by Jimmy, being 7 years old, followed by Snap, being 6 years old, and our youngest is Benny who is 10 months old! As you can tell, we're _big_ cat people! Another interest of mine is outer space. Although I'm not the best at science, I've always been fascinated by astrology, especially the moon! 
## Academic Life 
English has always been one of my best subjects and the subject I most enjoyed in school, so it makes sense now that I'm an English major! On campus, I have a job in the **Writing Center** where I give students advice on their work at any stage in the writing process. So, if you ever need help with a paper, feel free to come to me! Last semester, I also worked as a Writing Associate where I worked specifically with a certain class in helping them develop their writing skills through their class assignments. In this case, it was Dr. Teekell's ENGL 223 class which was so much fun! If you ever get the chance to take Dr. Teekell for something, please do! I also am invloved with the **Campus Activities Board (CAB)** as a member of the Marketing committee. Basically, this means I help design and create promotional materials, create social media posts, and develop creative ways to advertise our events to CNU students. Being involved in CAB's Marketing has been such a rewarding experience between all the new friends I've made and the ways I've been able to develop my creativity and logical thinking skills.
## Career Aspirations 
For a while, I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career. I came into a college having a vague knowledge of the field I wanted to go into, but no clue what I would do there. Recently, I came to an realization that I wanted to be an early childhood/elementary school teacher and, eventually, an elementary reading specialist. I've always known I loved working with little kids, but it was my job this summer as a summer camp counselor that solidified that I wanted to make working with children a part of my career. I've also known that I love teaching for a while and I find it so rewarding to be able to use my knowledge in a way that can benefit someone else. I specifically want to be a reading specialist because I love teaching reading and writing, which is probably why I applied for the job in the Writing Center! I've worked with children for years, from volunteering at my church's Vacation Bible School and my high school's children's theatre camps to substituting at the school where my mom teaches kindergarten to an Independent Study I did junior and senior year of high school. This Independent Study involved going into an Introduction to Theatre class and modifying the curriculum in order to teach it to the Special Education students in the class at a level that best suits their abilities. It was so rewarding to see them branch out and engage with their fellow classmates and to get to know them all on such a unique level throughout the school year. To accomplish my career goals, I plan to go to graduate school for early childhood education, then teach while I earn my Reading Specialist certification!
