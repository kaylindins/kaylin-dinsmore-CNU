# All About Me!
Hi everyone! My name is Kaylin Dinsmore (she/her) and I am a junior from Virginia Beach, VA! I am an English (Writing) major with minors in Communication Studies and Childhood Studies. I took this course as an elective for my English major and I thought it looked like an interesting topic! I don't consider myself _super_ technologically savvy so I thought this course would be a great way for me to expand both my digital and writing skills to help me in my future endeavors!
