When I heard we’d be doing a project with coding, I was very intimidated. I don’t consider myself a tech-savvy person and I had no experience with coding, but I learned that coding our TEI with Oxygen was a lot easier than I anticipated! 

Before we started coding, we marked up our assigned passage of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula’s Guest” in a Google Doc. We looked for features that we would later code such as page breaks, paragraph breaks, quotes, emdashes, and other special features of the text.

Doing this first step helped ease the coding process because we already knew which features we needed to code once we started using Oxygen. For me, it also helped ease my worries about the coding process because I went in with an outline of the codes I needed to write. 

Once we had our TEI on paper (or Google Doc) completed, we were introduced to Oxygen, the coding software. When I first opened Oxygen, I was overwhelmed by all the coding symbols and language that were all over the page. I thought that this would be way too complicated for me and that I would have to take several days to complete it. But, once I was introduced to all the tags and walked through a step-by-step process on how to do it, I found that it was a lot easier than I was expecting! 

I quickly got to work coding my passage and frequently double checked my work to make sure I was inputting everything correctly. I actually thought it was interesting to input my code in the Text view, then tab over to the Author view and see how my code was making the text appear on the page.

I did find that I had to adjust some of the indents so that my code appeared polished, but this wasn't difficult and I ended up finishing it in one class period! I was pleasantly surprised by this because I thought that I would have to struggle over my code for days before getting it right. 

The biggest thing I learned from this process is to step out of my comfort zone. Coding with Oxygen was something that was way out of my comfort zone, but I actually found it to be a fun and easy process! I would never have known this if I had not taken the risk to experience something I was unfamiliar with and see what benefits I could gain from it. 

I also learned that not being afraid to ask questions is important. I did have to ask several questions about my format and if I was using the right tags, but I learned that this was vital to my code turning out correct and that there are many resources available, including my professor, that are happy to lend a hand!
