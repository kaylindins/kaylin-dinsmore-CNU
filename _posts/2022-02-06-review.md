_The Bloodaxe Archive_ is a collection of poems published under Bloodaxe Books since 1978. Newcastle University collected these poems to unite people who love poetic literature. The archive gives them one-stop access to the poets published under the iconic Bloodaxe name.

The archive offers many different ways to engage with the material. There are many different sections that each allow the user to interact with the poem in a different way. These sections include **Books**, **Words**, **Shapes**, **Data**, **Gallery**, and **Research.**

When opening this project, the user sees a home page which describes the archive and what kinds of works are in it. It also has a description of what each section of the archive includes with links leading the user to them. Having this **About** section be the first thing a user sees lets the viewer become familiar with the project. It also gives them a sense of direction as they explore the archive. The links to the different sections work at a very fast pace and seem to be very efficient. 

In the **Books** section, users are able to browse the different collections in the archive. There are many ways to sort the material, which makes it easier for the viewer to find what they are looking for. There is also a way to search for books using keywords, which is very helpful for a user looking for collections on a particular topic. However, when clicking on a poem, the scanned image of it takes a long time to load and it can be hard to read without zooming in. This can be done, but, it requires going into the drop down menu under “Change the view” and clicking Viewer which may not be clear to some users. 

In the **Words** section, there are many creative ways for a user to interact with the archive. They can choose a theme from the drop down menu and see a list of related keywords or they can search a word of their own. Once they choose a word, a web graphic is brought up with the word in the center. The graphic expands into the collections that use the word and then expands into the specific poems where the word is used. Hovering over an individual dot displays the title of the work and clicking on the dot takes you directly to it. This graphic is colorful, creative and an engaging way for users to interact with the archive. 

The **Data** section is very engaging and the color coded graphic draws the viewer’s attention. This section intends to let users see where else poets from the archive have been published. However, it would have been more helpful to provide links to these outside sources so users can access them from the archive. 

The **Shapes** section is another creative way to engage with the works of the archive. Users can either choose a shape out of the many provided or they can use their cursor to draw a shape of their own. Doing this brings up all the poems in the archive that make that shape on the page. Clicking on the image of a poem enlarges it so that users can read it. This is a very engaging way to interact with the literature in a more visual sense. 

In the **Gallery** and **Research** sections, users can find many materials related to poems published in the archive. These materials include interviews with authors, videotaped readings, photographs, and annotated poems. All links in these sections work at a fast pace and all videos load quickly. The interviews and the recorded readings all have high quality audio and video. The annotated poems are fascinating to look at, but, when clicking on one, there is a very large description of the annotations on the side. This chunk of text is not visually appealing and the user is likely to skim it or not read it at all. These sections also experience the same issue as other sections with the images taking a long time to load. Other than that, it is a great resource for those who want to expand their knowledge outside the archive. 

_The Bloodaxe Archive_ is a creative way for those who love literature to engage with the poems published under Bloodaxe Books. Although there are some issues that need to be addressed for better usability, this project provides an engaging way to interact with poetry that users will find fascinating.
