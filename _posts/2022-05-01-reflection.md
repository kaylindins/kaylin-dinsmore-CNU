When I signed up for this class, I had no idea what Digital Humanities was. I thought that this was going to be a class focused on writing for social media, as weird as that sounds now. But, through this class, I learned about a field that fascinates me as someone majoring in the humanities and I improved my technological skills, which will be helpful in a world becoming more technologically advanced by the minute. 

Throughout this class, I found myself challenged, but in a way that was intellectually stimulating. I was challenged through readings, assignments, and subject matter that were something I had never experienced before. 

One of the readings that challenged me the most was “Programming as Literacy” by Annette Vee. It took me a while to understand that programming can be seen as a form of literacy. I had always associated literacy with reading and writing. Meanwhile, I associated programming with science and technology. It never occurred to me that understanding programming can be a literacy itself, and a perhaps necessary one given how technological our society has become. 

My favorite reading this semester was “Shitty First Drafts” by Anne Lamott. It was a nice change of pace to read something for a class that was not so academic sounding and the title automatically caught my attention. This reading was funny, so it kept me engaged, but it also had a message that stuck with me as an English major and writer. As I mentioned in my tweet about the reading, I often feel like my essays have to be perfect the first time I write them and it puts a lot of pressure on me. This reading helped me realize that even the greatest writers don’t write perfect first drafts and that it’s normal to just write, no matter how bad it may seem at first.

Throughout this semester, the assignments we completed were both challenging and interesting. The assignment that I found both the most challenging and most interesting was the grant assignment. It was challenging because it required me to think about things I never thought about when writing before such as writing to a more general audience and writing in a way that convinces my audience my project is meaningful. I got to hone and expand these writing skills which will be useful in non-academic settings. 

I also found the grant assignment interesting because I got to research and come up with a proposal for a topic I am passionate about. I thought it was awesome that I got to come up with an idea for a project that would better the field of humanities and, by the time my proposal was done, I found myself wanting to actually create this project. 

One thing I wish had been done differently about the grant project is having a more thorough review about different softwares that we could use for our project. The biggest thing I struggled with when writing my proposal was figuring out what software I could feasibly use for my archive. I did some research, but I found that I did not have the technological knowledge to truly understand which would be the best fit for my project. I did the best I could, but I think I would have struggled less with this part of the proposal if there had been some formal, in class lecture on what softwares would be best for certain projects. 

One assignment that I thought was going to be more challenging was the TEI assignment. This is not to say there was anything wrong with the assignment, but that I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the coding was. When I first heard that we were going to be coding, I was a little scared. I consider myself moderately tech savvy, but this seemed like something that was out of my range of abilities. 

The way that we did this assignment in two parts, first on Google Docs then on the coding software, helped calm my fears about this assignment because I went into the coding aspect of the project with a vague idea of what I was doing. The coding software looked overwhelming at first, but having step by step instructions of what to do made the coding so much easier and I was actually able to finish it in 5 minutes. This assignment increased my confidence when it came to my technological skills and I was ultimately proud of myself for being able to say that I could code, even if on a very basic level.

Though this course was nothing like I thought it would be, I think that is a good thing! I was able to learn about a new, fascinating field, increase my technology skills, and learn how to write in ways that I never thought of before. Learning how to use more advanced technology and how to write in a more general, persuasive format are the two most valuable lessons I think I learned in this class and I know they both will be of great use in my future.
